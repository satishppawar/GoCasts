# GO BASICS

## Go CLI

1. go run main.go --> compiles and executes result

2. go build main.go --> Compile only

## GO Package

- In Go, source files are organized into system directories called packages, which enable code reusability across the Go applications

- There are 2 types of packages in go

a. executable package - generates a file that we can execute.This is main package and it will have main method implemantation.

e.g. package main

b. Reusable package - code used as `helpers`. Good place to put reusable code

e.g. other than main package


### fmt package

- it is std library in go and implements formatted I/O with functions analogous to C's printf and scanf.
